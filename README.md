I hope this can serve as a way to share the physics code we wrote for various vehicles/characters in the past homework.

Let me know if you have any questions or if you think of a way to make this more streamlined/easier to use!


## Adding Your Code:

1. Clone this repo locally to your machine
2. Create a new folder in the format above
   1. Mine, for example, is "trevor-car-physics"
3. Add either your whole project folder, or just the parts that you're comfortable sharing/what's important
4. Enjoy!
