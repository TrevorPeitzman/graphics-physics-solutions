# graphics-physics-solutions

I hope this can serve as a way to share the physics code we wrote for various vehicles/characters in the past homework.

Let me know if you have any questions or if you think of a way to make this more streamlined/easier to use!


## Adding Your Code:

1. Clone this repo locally to your machine
   1. ``git clone https://github.com/TrevorPeitzman/graphics-physics-solutions``
2. Create a new folder in the format above
   1. Mine, for example, is "trevor-car-physics"
   2. `mkdir yourname-yourproject-physics`
3. Add either your whole project folder, or just the parts that you're comfortable sharing/what's important
4. Commit & push - make sure you're in the `graphics-physics-solutions` folder
   1. `git stage *`
   2. `git commit` - type a commit message, doesn't have to be overly complicated, just put what you added
   3. `git push`
      1. You will have to generate a token if you haven't done so in a while on your machine. Directions for that are [here].(https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).
5. Enjoy! Thanks for contributing!
